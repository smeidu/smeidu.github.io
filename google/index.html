		<p><span class="sblcofo">Senior / Staff Interaction Designer (2015 - 2019)</span></p>
		<p>I worked 4 years on consistent UI components, accessiblity efforts and account settings across the Google universe (Munich - Silicon Valley - Tel Aviv).</p>
	</div> 
	<div class="twelve columns"><h3>OneGoogle Bar</h3></div>
	<div class="twelve colums"><img src="ogb.png"></div>	
	<div class="twelve colums">
		<p>OneGoogle was born as an effort to bring consitency (and engeneering efficiency) to the back in 2016 widely indepentend Google products. Goal was that a user of e.g. Gmail is familiar, pleased and efficient with main UI components like the Top App Bar and finds the same consistent UI elements on other products like Calender, Docs, .... </p>
		<p><img src="ogb2.png"></p>
		<p>As UX Lead of OneGoogle I was responsible to collaborate with all those UX teams of the various Google products (there are many!), to synthisize their and the user needs of a global audience into usable user interface components.</p>

		<h3>OneGoogle top right pattern</h3>
	</div>	
	<div class="six columns"><p><img src="onegoogle_ap-pattern.png"></p></div>
	<div class="six columns">
		<p>In late 2017 I was stepping up within Google's UX org from focusing primarily on UI components to also defining and driving vision, patterns and strategy for better representing users within Google products. This work fundamentally shifted how a user and their identity is showcased across all of Google.</p>
		<p>A clear representation of the user’s identity, the account status and the Google brand - “It’s me, it’s a Google app, I’m logged in. Users can distinguish (within a single tap) which account data is being read from or written to. Users can control which, if any, account to use. The Account Menu is focused on representing the signed-in account, providing users with tools to manage this account and switching to other accounts. The Popover UI pattern was built to suit most of Google’s 1P apps.</p>
		<p>By June 2019 most of Google’s 1P apps have launched the OneGoogle pattern and account popover.</p>

		<h3>Gmail Relaunch</h3>
		<p>A product always very close to OneGoogle was Gmail. Therefore we often released major updates to UX patterns and UI components first with their product. In this case the UX patterns and UI components for the navigation drawer and the top right user representation and account menu were provided by OneGoogle.</p>

	<h3>Accessbility UX</h3>
	<p>Over the years I contributed in many "20%" of my time to A11y efforts across the Google universe. Starting with thorough accessibility testing (within the Google internal A11y ratings), bug filing and fixing for upcoming major launches of Google products and flows I quickly became a go to person for consulting on A11y UX topics. This gave me chance to work with a wide range of teams at Google to improve the assecibility of services and products that are used by billions of people every day. Definitly a career highlight for me!</p>
